# ${1:IMD Fall 2021 - Final Integrated Project}

## About the Project
For the FIP, I create a 3-page cooking website in the topic of plant-based recipe. Kind Kitchen is the imaginary name of the website. The theme of the design is warming and minimalistic. In this website, you will find plant-based recipes and articles covering a wide range of subjects with photographys taken by myself. Enjoy!
